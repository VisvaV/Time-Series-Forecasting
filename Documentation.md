# Time Series Forecasting Documentation

## Introduction

Time series analysis is a statistical technique used to analyze data points gathered at consistent intervals over a time span. It aims to detect patterns and trends in the data, which can be used for predicting future values.

## Components of Time Series

1. **Trend**: Represents the long-term direction or movement in the data.
2. **Seasonality**: Captures periodic fluctuations that occur at fixed intervals.
3. **Cycles**: Long-term oscillations that are not of a fixed frequency.
4. **Irregularity (Noise)**: Random variations that do not follow any pattern.

## Types of Time Series Data

1. **Stationary**: Data where the statistical properties remain constant over time.
2. **Non-Stationary**: Data where the mean or variance changes over time.

## Steps in Time Series Analysis

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gather data and handle missing values, outliers, and data normalization.
2. **Visualization**: Plot the data to identify patterns and trends.
3. **Decomposition**: Break down the series into its components (trend, seasonality, residuals).
4. **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate model based on the data characteristics.
5. **Model Validation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like MAE, RMSE, MAPE.
6. **Forecasting**: Use the validated model to predict future values.

## Common Time Series Models

1. **Auto-Regressive (AR) Model**: Predicts future values based on past values.
2. **Moving Average (MA) Model**: Uses the errors (residuals) from past predictions to forecast future values.
3. **Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) Model**: Combines AR and MA models for better forecasting.
4. **Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Model**: Extends ARMA by including differencing to handle non-stationarity.
5. **Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) Model**: Includes seasonal components for data with periodic patterns.

## Statistical Tests for Stationarity

1. **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test**: Checks for the presence of a unit root, indicating non-stationarity.
2. **KPSS Test**: Tests for trend stationarity.

## Moving Averages

1. **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: Unweighted mean of past values.
2. **Cumulative Moving Average (CMA)**: Mean of all past values up to the current point.
3. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: Weighted mean giving more importance to recent values.

## Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation

1. **Autocorrelation Function (ACF)**: Measures the correlation between a time series and lagged versions of itself.
2. **Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)**: Measures the correlation between a time series and lagged versions of itself, controlling for intermediate effects.

## Applications of Time Series Analysis

1. **Weather Forecasting**: Predicting temperature, precipitation, and other weather conditions.
2. **Stock Market Predictions**: Forecasting stock prices and market trends.
3. **Signal Processing**: Analyzing signals over time in various fields like audio processing.
4. **Control Systems**: Monitoring and controlling processes in real-time systems.

## Limitations of Time Series Analysis

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Time series analysis typically requires complete data.
2. **Linearity Assumption**: Many models assume linear relationships between variables.

## Deep Learning in Time Series Analysis

1. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Effective for sequential data, especially with long-term dependencies.
2. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks**: A type of RNN that handles long-term dependencies well.

## Conclusion

Time series analysis is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting sequential data. By identifying patterns and trends, businesses can make informed decisions across various sectors. While traditional statistical models like ARIMA are widely used, deep learning techniques are increasingly applied for more complex forecasting tasks.
