# Time-Series Forecasting

This project is a comprehensive time series forecasting application built using Python and Flask. It utilizes various statistical models like ARIMA and SARIMA to predict temperature trends. The application includes a web interface to visualize and forecast temperature data.

## Features

- **Time Series Visualization**: Plots time series data for better understanding.
- **Moving Averages**: Calculates Simple, Cumulative, and Exponential Moving Averages.
- **ACF/PACF Plots**: Displays Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation plots.
- **ARIMA/SARIMA Forecasting**: Predicts future temperature values using ARIMA and SARIMA models.
- **Stationarity Tests**: Performs Augmented Dickey-Fuller and KPSS tests for stationarity.
- **Metrics Calculation**: Computes Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error.
